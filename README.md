This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns
# 🚦 Traffic Accident Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes traffic accident data to identify patterns related to:
- Road conditions
- Weather conditions
- Time of day

It also visualizes accident hotspots using geographical data.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand how road and weather conditions affect accident severity
- Identify high-risk time periods for accidents
- Visualize accident-prone locations (hotspots)
- Gain insights for traffic safety improvements

---

## 📂 Dataset
A sample accident dataset was created containing:
- Date & Time
- City & Location (Latitude, Longitude)
- Road Condition
- Weather
- Time of Day
- Accident Severity
- Vehicle Type

📁 File: `data/accident_data.csv`

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Key Analysis & Insights
- Poor and wet road conditions lead to higher accident severity
- Rain and fog increase accident frequency
- Morning rush hours and night-time have higher risks
- Urban areas show higher accident concentration

---

## 🔥 Visualizations
- Accidents by Road Condition
- Accidents by Weather
- Accidents by Time of Day
- Accident Hotspots (Latitude vs Longitude)

---
